KRR Stack Algorithm
==================================

This is a new probabilistic stack algorithm named KRR which can be used to accurately model random sampling based-LRU under arbitrary sampling size K (K-LRU).

The KRR model is first described in:
> Efficient Modeling of Random Sampling-Based LRU(ICPP'21)

Folders ____, ______, contains the basic model described in ICPP'21 paper
